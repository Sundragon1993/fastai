    "I'll be using a *top-down* teaching method, which is different from how most math courses operate.  Typically, in a *bottom-up* approach, you first learn all the separate components you will be using, and then you gradually build them up into more complex structures.  The problems with this are that students often lose motivation, don't have a sense of the \"big picture\", and don't know what they'll need.\n",

For each tree, we will call `predict` with our validation set. `np.stack` concatenates them together on a new axis, so the resulting `preds` has the shape of `(10, 12000)` (10 trees, 12000 validation set). The mean of 10 predictions for the first data is 9.07, and the actual value is 9.10. As you can see, none of the individual prediction is close to 9.10, but the mean ends up pretty good."
